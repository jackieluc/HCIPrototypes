<h2>A possible scenario:</h2>
<p>Consider that you are a person who enjoys watching your favourite Netflix shows or watching YouTube videos on your off-time. You decide to open up JCREntertainment on your desktop computer to start watching something on Netflix. You click on Netflix and you watch the latest episode of your favourite show but halfway-through, you realized you needed to go buy grocceries and you decide to pause it and shut off your desktop computer to save electricity. You come back hours later and you turn y our desktop computer back on and open JCREntertainment and click on the resume-watching section, which shows you that you have one show to resume! You click on it and resume watching where you last left off. You finish your show and thought it was so amazing that you needed to share with your friends on social media! So now you log in (or you were previously logged in) and click on your account button and your social media feeds open up. You share your experience with a direct link to the content you are referring to. Now that you've shared your experience, you go back and enjoy some more!</p>



<h2>Vertical Prototype</h2>
<p></p>

<h3>How to use:</h3>
<p>Open in Visual Studio 2013 and press F5</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:none">There are two accounts you can use to log in to explore social features:
	<li>Username: john.smith@gmail.com</li>
	<li>Password: JCREntertainment</li>

	<li>Username: alex.wong@gmail.com</li>
	<li>Password: CPSC481</li>
</ul>

<p></p>
<h3>What can I do?</h3>
<p>You are free to navigate the entirety of the prototype with a few exception of some features. To start, you can use streaming services such as YouTube, Netflix, and Spotify, given that you have access to their services. You also have access system settings and to local media content such as locally saved movies, tv shows, and music. This prototype is targeted at users who love consuming media content and sharing it with friends with social media. You can (register and) log in to your account and you will have access to account-specified settings and preferences that you can apply every time you log in. You have access to your social feed, in which you can sign in to your Facebook and/or Twitter account to follow new content that is coming or to share your experiences directly to your social media. As of the current moment, you can favourite local content to have a "shortcut" access if you have a large amount of media. You can also recommend your local content to someone else who has an account as well, or ideally share it on social media. Our users are always on the go and change their media consumption setting frequently, and a solution to this is to provide the means to optionally start the media content from where they last left off. This saves them the trouble of finding where they last left off or starting over again.</p>
