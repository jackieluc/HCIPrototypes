<h2>A possible scenario:</h2>
<p>Consider that you are a person who enjoys watching your favourite Netflix shows or watching YouTube videos on your off-time. You decide to open up JCREntertainment on your desktop computer to start watching something on Netflix. You click on Netflix and you watch the latest episode of your favourite show but halfway-through, you realized you needed to go buy grocceries and you decide to pause it and shut off your desktop computer to save electricity. You come back hours later and you turn y our desktop computer back on and open JCREntertainment and click on the resume-watching section, which shows you that you have one show to resume! You click on it and resume watching where you last left off. You finish your show and thought it was so amazing that you needed to share with your friends on social media! So now you log in (or you were previously logged in) and click on your account button and your social media feeds open up. You share your experience with a direct link to the content you are referring to. Now that you've shared your experience, you go back and enjoy some more!</p>
